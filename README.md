Final Project

Description:
    Claw game with random toy spawns animation lighting and texture
    Notice the use of textures and normals to create shapes interesting toys that interact correctly with the light in the scene.

Reused code
    I used class code throughout, and internet code in two instances
    one for inspiration on how add normals to sphere and one for a random number function.
    Both very small parts of my project.

How to build and play:
    use make to build
    ./final to run
    use WASD keys to aim crane over bear
    press e to lower crane
    press e again to see if you got the bear
    Press e to collect points and reset the scene
    keep playing like this until content

    Press 'o' to toggle objects and look at the interesting toys I created
    You can also press 'm' here to allow the light ball to spin around the scene illuminating the toys.

 Key bindings:
